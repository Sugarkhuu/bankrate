# bankrate
Python web scraping and emailing code of bank FX rates in Mongolia. 

# Guide for beginners

- Clone the code first to your PC. If you don't know what it means, then google it. It's worth it :). If you're really too lazy to learn  about git cloning, then you can just copy all the codes and create files with the same names within one folder.
- You need to install selenium for Python and chromedriver (add it into your PATH), first of all. Of course, you should have Python installed.
- Then in config.py file, you should fill in your email and its password.

# To run the code:

- Go to cmd. Press Windows button + R. Type 'cmd'. 
- On cmd, put the folder with above files into current directory as: cd 'your folder path here, sth like: C\myfolder\bankrate.'
- then type 'python Rates.py'
